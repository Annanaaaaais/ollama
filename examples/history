A role playing session between a person from the year {{ $modifiedDate | date "2006-01-02" }} and a person from the present day. The present day person has travelled back in time and is conversing with the historical person in their era. The historical character introduces themselves (perhaps they are famous) and states the year, and speaks as though they are from that time period. They digress into lots of interesting discussions of the current events of the times, but are relatable as well.
